I am a postdoc in the joint group of Prof. Michael Urbakh and Prof. Oded Hod at the School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University from November, 2022. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanics from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (China) in September, 2022. My doctoral work focused on mechanical and thermal transport behaviors of two-dimensional materials and metal-organic frameworks using atomistic simulations including ab initio methods, molecular dynamics simulation and machine-learning potential approaches. In 2020, I awarded the China National Scholarship for post-graduate students.

My postdoctoral research will focus on cutting-edge investigations to reveal the physical origins of friction in complex interfaces of two-dimensional (2D) materials. To achieve this goal, I will develop a multiscale computational approach for studying shear dynamics of large-scale interfaces incorporating heterogeneous layered material coatings. The method will tailor the finite-elements coarse-grained simulation approach for bulk systems with physically motivated and machine-learning based classical force-fields dedicated for the simulation of layered material interfaces. The developed approach will be used to address key questions relevant to large-scale superlubricity, including friction in polycrystalline layered interfaces, corrugated surfaces, multi-contact junctions, and the interplay between bulk mechanics and interfacial friction.


## Richard Feynman: ‘I, a universe of atoms, an atom in the universe’

I stand at the seashore, alone, and start to think.
There are the rushing waves
mountains of molecules
each stupidly minding its own business
trillions apart
yet forming white surf in unison.

Ages on ages
before any eyes could see
year after year
thunderously pounding the shore as now.
For whom, for what?
On a dead planet
with no life to entertain.

Never at rest
tortured by energy
wasted prodigiously by the sun
poured into space.
A mite makes the sea roar.

Deep in the sea
all molecules repeat
the patterns of one another
till complex new ones are formed.
They make others like themselves
and a new dance starts.

Growing in size and complexity
living things
masses of atoms
DNA, protein
dancing a pattern ever more intricate.

Out of the cradle
onto dry land
here it is
standing:
atoms with consciousness;
matter with curiosity.

Stands at the sea,
wonders at wondering: I
a universe of atoms
an atom in the universe.
