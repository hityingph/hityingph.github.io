Two-dimensional (2D) lateral superlattices, a typical artificial nano-phononic crystal, have stimulated widespread interests and potential application prospects in terms of their physically interesting features. Herein, we have found wave-particle crossover of phonon transport in the graphene (Gr)/2D polyaniline (C$_3$N) lateral superlattices, which is an indication of a transition in the phonon transport mechanism from the incoherent to coherent regime. Due to the high structural similarity of C$_3$N to Gr, the thermal conductivity of the Gr/C$_3$N lateral superlattice can achieve an ultra-wide modulation range of about 500 $\sim$ 1100 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, which is far beyond that of other superlattices. The analysis shows that an increase of the interface density will on the one hand weaken the thermal conductivity by increasing phonon-interface scattering, and on the other hand increase it by lowering the phonon transport barriers and allowing more long-wavelength phonons to participate in the transport. This determines the parabolic trend of thermal conductivity containing the minimum, and also reflects the dual effects of hetero-interfaces on phonon thermal transport. In addition, phonon calculations show that the above variation in thermal conductivity is entirely attributable to differences in the phonon mean free path for different interface densities and is not related to their group velocity.
