Long-term illumination can damage the mechanical properties of high strength fiber composites, resulting in the material aging and loss of mechanical properties. To reveal the mechanism of ultraviolet- (UV-) induced damage, in this paper, a nonlinear constitutive model is developed to describe the elastic and inelastic deformation behavior of high strength fibers under UV-radiation and mechanical loadings. Two internal variables are employed to measure the effects of damage caused by UV-radiation and by mechanical loadings, respectively. The Helmholtz free energy function and the evolution equations of these two internal variables are investigated elaborately and given explicitly for high strength fibers. The proposed theoretical model is then applied to analyze the mechanical degradation of high-performance high strength fibers under uniaxial tension. The modulus and strength of the material predicted by the theoretical model match the aging experimental results rather well, which verifies the rationality and accuracy of the present model. This model is expected to predict the evolution of mechanical properties of high-strength fibers under UV-radiation, which can also provide a theoretical basis for the development of anti-UV technology of fiber reinforced composites.
