We propose an approach that can accurately predict the heat conductivity of liquid water. On the one hand, we develop an accurate
machine-learned potential based on the neuroevolution-potential approach that can achieve quantum-mechanical accuracy at the cost of
empirical force fields. On the other hand, we combine the Greenâ€“Kubo method and the spectral decomposition method within the homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics framework to account for the quantum-statistical effects of high-frequency vibrations. Excellent
agreement with experiments under both isobaric and isochoric conditions within a wide range of temperatures is achieved using our approach.
