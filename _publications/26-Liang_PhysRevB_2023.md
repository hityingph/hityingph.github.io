Amorphous silica (a-SiO2) is a foundational disordered material for which the thermal transport properties are important for various applications. To accurately model the interatomic interactions in classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of thermal transport in a-SiO2, we herein develop an accurate yet highly efficient machine-learned potential model that allows us to generate a-SiO2 samples closely resembling experimentally produced ones. Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium MD method and a proper quantum-statistical correction to the classical MD results, quantitative agreement with experiments is achieved for the thermal conductivities of bulk and 190-nm-thick a-SiO2 films over a wide range of temperatures. To interrogate the thermal vibrations at different temperatures, we calculated the current correlation functions corresponding to the transverse acoustic and longitudinal acoustic collective vibrations. The results reveal that, below the Ioffe-Regel crossover frequency, phonons as well-defined excitations remain applicable in a-SiO2 and play a predominant role at low temperatures, resulting in a temperature-dependent increase in thermal conductivity. In the high-temperature region, more phonons are excited, accompanied by a more intense liquidlike diffusion event. We attribute the temperature-independent thermal conductivity in the high-temperature range of a-SiO2 to the collaborative involvement of excited phonon scattering and liquidlike diffusion in heat conduction. These findings provide physical insights into the thermal transport of a-SiO2 and are expected to be applied to a vast range of amorphous materials.
